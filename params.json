Including LCD Display and 1-button interface.\r\n\r\nDo you want to work on something, fully focused? Maybe [The Pomodoro Technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) can help you. It dictates that you work in blocks of 25-minutes.\r\n\r\n## Timer\r\nInspired by this concept, I made my own Pomodoro Timer, with an Arduino of course ;) I made a prototype, with a breadboarded Arduino and only a Lego casing around the display, but it could also be built into a proper case of course.\r\n\r\n![Prototype of the Pomodoro Timer](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-D8MTyGYdg0s/UgT_7tsC1YI/AAAAAAAAEvI/d-NAd8UmFdk/s400/Screen+Shot+2013-08-09+at+16.23.26.png)\r\n\r\nWhen connecting to power, it will automatically start counting down 25 minutes (default). When your time is up, you will hear a beep and the timer shuts its display down. With one press on the button and you can start a new session. When pressing the button multiple times, you can switch the count-down period.\r\n\r\n## One button\r\nThe timer had to be super-easy to operate, so it only has one button. This button will make the timer:\r\n\r\n* Reset the current session when already counting down;\r\n* Switch to a different count-down period (25 (default), 45, 5 or 15 minutes);\r\n* Start a new session when stopped.\r\n\r\n## Display\r\nThe display I used is a [3-Wire LED Module from DFRobot](http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/3-Wire_LED_Module_(SKU:DFR0090)).\r\n\r\n## Demonstration\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/yk0zJRWw_6c?rel=0","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
